                Born from a simple family, grew up to be an independent child, who likes new things and challenges. 
                Growing up in a family that is not harmonious, but it's not a problem, but everything is a mirror lesson. 
                My Motto "Your life's end determined by what you do today" At work I really like work that brings me into a positive or constructive challenge. 
                that's what allows me to survive in, as well as compete in today's world of work. More than all of that, "Rely on God In every second, minute, 
                hour in all aspects of your life, You can trust, success will be a part of you!"
